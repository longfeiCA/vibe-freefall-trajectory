# **App Name**: Freefall Trajectory

## Core Features:

- Trajectory Simulation: Simulate the trajectory of balls dropped from a moving plane, accounting for initial speed, acceleration, and gravity.
- Ball Path Visualization: Dynamically generate and display the paths of multiple balls dropped at constant intervals, updating in real-time as the simulation runs.
- Parameter Controls: Display of simulation parameters (plane speed, acceleration, drop interval) with an ability to adjust them using sliders and buttons.
- Simulation Reset: Reset the simulation to its initial state or other user-defined states. Provides different options.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky blue (#87CEEB), evocative of the sky through which the balls fall, lending a sense of realism and spaciousness.
- Background color: Light gray (#D3D3D3), offers a neutral backdrop that ensures the trajectories and simulation parameters stand out without causing distraction.
- Accent color: A warm orange (#FF4500), analogous to sky blue, for interactive elements, providing visual contrast and drawing attention to crucial elements like simulation controls.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern and objective feel.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent different simulation parameters and controls.
- Display the simulation parameters and trajectory display on the same screen using a modern dashboard-like layout.
- Implement smooth transitions for ball movements and parameter updates.
